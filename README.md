# TEM-tomo
A collection of Maltab scripts for use in TEM-based tomography


Folder: tilt-series-projections: 
  This folder contains scripts to generate a tilt series from a 3D volume input (image stack). This can be useful for understanding the limitations and artifacts (eg. missing wedge) of tomographic reconstructions based upon a limited series of image projections.
